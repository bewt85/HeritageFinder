Independent visitors need to be prepared for the remoteness of the Island, the difficulty of landing and departure during inclement weather or heavy seas, and the absence of power or any other public services on the Island if they get into difficulties.  \r\n\n\r\n Visitors attempting to land on the island also need to note that the owner does not own the pier or the lighthouse buildings or infrastructure and that some of these structures are in a dilapidated state and can present a hazard to visitors. The landscape is of an open nature and any paths - such as they exist - tend to be poorly defined, steep, and slippery in places.  The slopes leading down from the high ground to the top of the surrounding cliffs can be exceedingly hazardous at times. \r\n\n\r\n The public's right to land on the Island remains unrestricted but visitors are also asked to respect the island's wildlife and its seabird colony especially during the seabird-nesting season between \r\n\r\n 1 April and 30 September. \r\n\n\r\n To make the most of their visit, visitors are asked to follow the advice of RSPB, advisory signage on the island, and advice contained in literature supplied through the Estate Office and local Tourist Offices and other outlets on the mainland.",

Its appeal lies largely in its setting which may be seen via the signed footpath around the lake (Open during July and August).  Extended in the 1840's, the interior was largely remodelled in the 1960's and so is primarily of interest to architectural scholars.  The interior may be viewed by prior written appointment.

The family silver is very fine and is accompanied in the dining room by the Ongley Service, the most ornamental set of porcelain ever created by the Derby factory.  Florentine 16th century bronzes and an alabaster lady by Giambologna can be seen. The woodland gardens cover 77 acres and command spectacular views of the Lakeland Fells, with many delightful walks.  From mid-March to June the rhododendrons, azaleas, camellias and magnolias are at their best. The Owl Centre boasts a fine collection of owls from all over the world.",

    "access_details": "The property on the attached map constitutes an important site for breeding waders, principally snipe. Direct public access to the field between 1 February and 31 July each year would result in significant  disturbance to birds feeding, roosting or nesting during this period, which would be detrimental to their long-term conservation. Whilst English Nature consider that access would be acceptable during the remaining period of the year (1 August to 31 January), there would be little of ornithological or botanical interest for visitors to see and appreciate\r\n\n\r\n The elevated towpath of the Staffordshire and Worcester Canal, which forms the north western boundary of the property, provides the best possible location from which visitors may view the site. The towpath is raised some 2.5 metres above the field level and affords good views across the field, into drainage gripps and along field edge dykes and would be a preferred perspective for bird watching. Further, the canal bank is colonised by intermittent rank herbaceous vegetation and tree growth which serve to shield the visitor whilst providing sight lines into the field. The visitor is therefore afforded the opportunity to view the field whilst not disturbing its bird interest. This is further helped by the avoidance of direct access to the site.\r\n\n\r\n There are no public rights of way or permissive paths which enable access to the property.",
