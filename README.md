# Heritage Finder

The original Heritage Finder consists of three tools which help the public find
"privately owned heritage assets that have tax exemption".  More on this can be
found on [HMRC's Website](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/heritage/visit.htm).

This project is an exercise to learn some more javascript, a bit of bootstrap
and see how hard re-building a service like the Heritage Finder would be.

NB This project is not endorsed by HMRC in any way.
